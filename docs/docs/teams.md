# Share AI Agent Skills Across Your Team

Set up agr so everyone shares the same AI coding skills, stays in sync
across Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, and other tools — and gets productive on
day one.

---

## Set up your project

### 1. Initialize agr

Run this in your repo root:

```bash
agr init
```

This creates `agr.toml` and auto-detects which tools your team uses from
repo signals (`.claude/`, `.cursor/`, `CLAUDE.md`, etc.).

To target specific tools:

```bash
agr init --tools claude,cursor,codex
```

### 2. Add skills

Install the skills your team needs:

```bash
agr add anthropics/skills/frontend-design
agr add anthropics/skills/pdf
agr add ./skills/internal-review   # Local skills work too
```

Each `agr add` updates `agr.toml` with the dependency.

### 3. Commit agr.toml

```bash
git add agr.toml
git commit -m "Add agr skill dependencies"
```

`agr.toml` is your skill lockfile. Commit it so every clone starts with the
same skills.

### 4. Teammates install

After cloning the repo, a new teammate runs two commands:

```bash
uv tool install agr   # One-time install (or: pipx install agr)
agr sync              # Install all skills from agr.toml
```

Done. Everyone has the same skills in the same tool.

---

## Multi-tool teams

If your team uses different AI coding tools, configure all of them:

```bash
agr config set tools claude cursor codex
```

When anyone runs `agr add` or `agr sync`, skills are installed into every
configured tool's skills directory simultaneously. A skill added by someone
using Claude Code is also available to the teammate using Cursor.

See [Supported Tools](tools.md) for details on each tool.

### Keep instruction files in sync

When using multiple tools, you probably want one source of truth for your
project-level instructions (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`). Enable
instruction syncing:

```bash
agr config set sync_instructions true
agr config set canonical_instructions CLAUDE.md
```

Now `agr sync` copies `CLAUDE.md` content to `AGENTS.md` and `GEMINI.md`
as needed by your configured tools. Maintain one file, all tools stay aligned.

See [Configuration — Instruction Syncing](configuration.md#instruction-syncing) for details.

---

## Private skills

Teams often keep internal skills in private GitHub repositories. agr supports
this through environment variables — no configuration changes needed.

### Developer setup

Each developer exports a GitHub token:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_your_token_here"
```

Or, if you use the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/):

```bash
export GH_TOKEN="$(gh auth token)"
```

The token needs **Contents: Read-only** access on the repositories containing
your skills. Fine-grained tokens scoped to specific repos are recommended.

Add the export to your shell profile (`~/.zshrc`, `~/.bashrc`) for permanent
access.

### CI/CD setup

For automated environments, pass the token as a secret:

```yaml
- name: Sync skills
  run: agr sync
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SKILL_TOKEN }}
```

Create a fine-grained token with **Contents: Read-only** on your skill
repositories and add it as a repository secret.

See [Configuration — Private Repositories](configuration.md#private-repositories) for full details.

---

## CI/CD integration

Add `agr sync` to your CI pipeline to ensure skills are available in
automated environments.

### GitHub Actions

```yaml
- name: Install agr
  run: uv tool install agr

- name: Sync skills
  run: agr sync
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}  # Only needed for private repos
```

The `GITHUB_TOKEN` line is only required if your team uses private skill
repos. For public skills, `agr sync` works without authentication.

### Other CI systems

agr is a standard Python CLI. Install it with `pip install agr` or
`pipx install agr` in any CI environment that has Python 3.10+ and Git:

```bash
pip install agr
agr sync
```

Set `GITHUB_TOKEN` in your CI environment variables for private repos.

---

## Onboarding existing projects

If your project already has skills installed manually (copied into
`.claude/skills/` or similar), use the interactive onboard command:

```bash
agr onboard
```

This walks you through:

- Selecting which tools your team uses
- Discovering skills already in your tool directories
- Migrating them into `./skills/` as local dependencies
- Creating your `agr.toml`

If you have `.claude/commands/`, `.cursorrules`, or other files that should
become skills:

```bash
agrx kasperjunge/migrate-to-skills
```

---

## Adding and updating skills

### Add a new skill for the team

```bash
agr add anthropics/skills/pdf
git add agr.toml
git commit -m "Add pdf skill"
```

Teammates pick it up on their next `agr sync`.

### Update a skill to the latest version

```bash
agr add anthropics/skills/pdf --overwrite
```

The `--overwrite` flag replaces the installed skill with the latest version
from GitHub. Commit the updated skill files so the team stays in sync.

### Remove a skill

```bash
agr remove anthropics/skills/pdf
git add agr.toml
git commit -m "Remove pdf skill"
```

---

## Recommended workflow

A typical team workflow looks like this:

1. **One person** sets up `agr.toml` with the team's skills and commits it
2. **Everyone** runs `agr sync` after pulling to stay up to date
3. **Anyone** can add or remove skills — changes go through normal code review
4. **CI** runs `agr sync` to ensure skills are available in automated environments

The `agr.toml` file is the single source of truth. Treat it like any other
project dependency file.
