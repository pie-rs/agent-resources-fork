# agr — Skills for AI Agents

A package manager for AI agent skills. Install, share, and run skills across
Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, OpenCode, Copilot, and Antigravity — with a single
command.

## What are skills?

Skills are reusable instructions that teach AI coding agents how to perform
specific tasks — reviewing code, generating components, preparing releases, or
anything else you'd normally explain in a prompt. Each skill is a `SKILL.md`
file in a directory, published on GitHub.

Here's what one looks like:

```markdown
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Reviews code for bugs, security issues, and best practices.
---

# Code Reviewer

When reviewing code changes, follow these steps:

1. Read every changed file completely before commenting
2. Check for bugs: null references, off-by-one errors, race conditions
3. Check for security issues: injection, auth bypass, data exposure
4. Verify error handling: are errors caught, logged, and surfaced?

Format each finding as:
- **File and line:** `src/auth.py:42`
- **Severity:** bug / security / style
- **Fix:** concrete code or approach to resolve it
```

Install it, and your AI agent gains a new capability — no prompt engineering
each time.

### Why a package manager?

Without agr, managing skills means:

- **Manual copying** — download files from GitHub, figure out which folder each
  tool expects, copy them in
- **No updates** — when a skill improves, you repeat the process by hand
- **Team drift** — teammates have different skills, different versions, no
  single source of truth
- **Multi-tool pain** — using Claude Code *and* Cursor? Copy everything twice,
  into different directories

With agr:

```bash
agr add anthropics/skills/pdf          # Install from GitHub — one command
agr add anthropics/skills/pdf -o       # Update to the latest version
agr sync                               # Teammates get everything from agr.toml
agr config set tools claude cursor     # Multi-tool — skills install everywhere
```

## Install

=== "uv (recommended)"

    ```bash
    uv tool install agr
    ```

=== "pipx"

    ```bash
    pipx install agr
    ```

=== "pip"

    ```bash
    pip install agr
    ```

## Add your first skill

```bash
agr add anthropics/skills/frontend-design
```

That's it. The skill is now installed in your tool's skills folder. Invoke it:

| Tool | Invoke with |
|------|-------------|
| Claude Code | `/frontend-design` |
| Cursor | `/frontend-design` |
| OpenAI Codex | `$frontend-design` |
| OpenCode | `frontend-design` |
| GitHub Copilot | `/frontend-design` |
| Antigravity | *(via IDE)* |

!!! tip "No setup required"
    `agr add` auto-creates `agr.toml` if it doesn't exist and detects which
    tools you use. You don't need to run `agr init` first.

## Run a skill without installing

```bash
agrx anthropics/skills/pdf -p "Extract tables from report.pdf"
```

`agrx` downloads the skill, runs it with your tool, and cleans up. Nothing is
saved to your project.

## Sync skills across a team

Dependencies are tracked in `agr.toml`:

```toml
dependencies = [
    {handle = "anthropics/skills/frontend-design", type = "skill"},
    {handle = "anthropics/skills/skill-creator", type = "skill"},
]
```

Teammates install everything with:

```bash
agr sync
```

## Create your own

```bash
agr init my-skill                # Scaffold a new skill
# Edit my-skill/SKILL.md with your instructions
agr add ./my-skill               # Test locally
# Push to GitHub, then others can:
agr add your-username/my-skill
```

See [Creating Skills](creating.md) for the full guide.

## Commands

| `agrx <handle>` | Run a skill temporarily |

## Example skills

**Documents & data** — read, create, and transform office files:

```bash
agr add anthropics/skills/pdf              # Extract tables, summarize, create PDFs
agr add anthropics/skills/docx             # Generate and edit Word documents
agr add anthropics/skills/xlsx             # Build and manipulate spreadsheets
agr add anthropics/skills/pptx             # Create and work with slide decks
agr add anthropics/skills/doc-coauthoring  # Structured doc co-authoring workflow
```

**Design & frontend** — build UIs and visual assets:

```bash
agr add anthropics/skills/frontend-design   # Production-grade interfaces
agr add anthropics/skills/canvas-design     # Visual art in PNG and PDF
agr add anthropics/skills/algorithmic-art   # Algorithmic art with p5.js
agr add anthropics/skills/theme-factory     # Style artifacts with themes
agr add anthropics/skills/brand-guidelines  # Anthropic brand colors and typography
```

**Development** — build integrations and test apps:

```bash
agr add anthropics/skills/claude-api             # Build apps with the Claude API
agr add anthropics/skills/mcp-builder            # Create MCP servers
agr add anthropics/skills/web-artifacts-builder  # Multi-component HTML artifacts
agr add anthropics/skills/webapp-testing         # Test web apps with Playwright
```

**Productivity** — create skills and content:

```bash
agr add anthropics/skills/skill-creator     # Create, modify, and improve skills
agr add anthropics/skills/internal-comms    # Write internal communications
agr add anthropics/skills/slack-gif-creator # Create animated GIFs for Slack
```

**Community skills** — built and shared by the community:

```bash
agr add dsjacobsen/agent-resources/golang-pro             # Go — @dsjacobsen
agr add madsnorgaard/drupal-agent-resources/drupal-expert  # Drupal — @madsnorgaard
agr add maragudk/skills/collaboration                      # Workflow — @maragudk
agr add kasperjunge/commit-work                            # Commits — @kasperjunge
```
