# AGR — Skills for AI Agents

A package and project manager for AI agent skills. Install, share, and run skills from GitHub with a single command.

!!! note "Migrating from rules, subagents, or slash commands?"
    Support for rules, subagents, and slash commands has been removed. Most AI coding agents are converging on skills as the standard format, so agr now focuses exclusively on skills. To convert your existing files to skills, run:

    ```bash
    agrx kasperjunge/migrate-to-skills
    agrx kasperjunge/migrate-to-skills -p "convert files in ./my-commands"
    ```

## Install

```bash
uv tool install agr
```

## Choose Your Path

### Install a Skill (persist it)

```bash
agr add anthropics/skills/frontend-design
```

This installs the skill into your tool's skills folder. Use `--source <name>` to
pick a non-default source from `agr.toml`.

### Run a Skill Once (no install)

```bash
agrx anthropics/skills/pdf                  # Run once, then clean up
agrx anthropics/skills/pdf -p "Extract tables from report.pdf"
agrx anthropics/skills/pdf -i               # Interactive: run skill, then continue chatting
```

The `-i` flag runs the skill first, then starts an interactive session so you can
continue the conversation.

### Share with Your Team

Dependencies are tracked in `agr.toml`:

```toml
dependencies = [
    {handle = "anthropics/skills/frontend-design", type = "skill"},
    {handle = "anthropics/skills/skill-creator", type = "skill"},
]
```

Teammates install everything with:

```bash
agr sync
```

### Create a Skill

```bash
agr init my-skill
```

Then edit `my-skill/SKILL.md`. If you want it in this repo, place it under
`./skills/`.

### Migrate Old Rules or Commands

```bash
agrx kasperjunge/migrate-to-skills
```

## Commands (Quick Reference)

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `agr add <handle>` | Install a skill |
| `agr remove <handle>` | Uninstall a skill |
| `agr sync` | Install all dependencies from `agr.toml` |
| `agr list` | Show skills and installation status |
| `agr init` | Create `agr.toml` (auto-detects tools) |
| `agr init <name>` | Create a skill scaffold |
| `agr onboard` | Interactive guided setup |
| `agrx <handle>` | Run a skill temporarily |

## Handle Format

```bash
agr add user/skill              # From user's "skills" repo
agr add user/repo/skill         # From a different repo
agr add ./path/to/skill         # Local path
```

If a user's repo is named `skills`, you can skip the repo name:

```bash
agr add kasperjunge/commit                    # From kasperjunge/skills
agr add kasperjunge/skills/commit             # Same thing (explicit)
```

Note: `user/skill` now defaults to `skills`. During a deprecation period, agr
will fall back to `agent-resources` (with a warning) if the skill isn't found in
`skills`.

## How Skill Discovery Works

When you run `agr add user/repo/skill`, agr searches that repo for a skill named
`skill`. It will be found if it exists in:

- `resources/skills/{skill}/SKILL.md`
- `skills/{skill}/SKILL.md`
- `{skill}/SKILL.md`

If two skills have the same name, you'll get an error.

## Project Setup

```bash
agr init       # Create agr.toml (auto-detects tools)
agr onboard    # Interactive guided setup
```

`agr init` creates `agr.toml` and detects which tools you use from repo signals
(`.claude/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursor/`, `.cursorrules`, etc.).

`agr onboard` walks you through tool selection, skill discovery, migration from
tool folders into `./skills/`, and configuration.

## Example Skills

```bash
agr add anthropics/skills/frontend-design    # Build production-grade UIs
agr add anthropics/skills/skill-creator      # Create new skills
agr add anthropics/skills/pdf                # Work with PDF documents
```
