# Skill Directory

!!! tldr
    **Official skills** from Anthropic cover documents (PDF, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX),
    design, frontend, API integration, and productivity. **Community skills** add
    Go, Drupal, workflow automation, and more. Try any skill instantly with
    `agrx user/skill` or install with `agr add user/skill`.

Browse available skills and find ones that fit your workflow. Every skill below
works with all [supported tools](tools.md) — Claude Code, Cursor, Codex,
OpenCode, GitHub Copilot, and Antigravity — and can be tried instantly without
installing using [`agrx`](agrx.md):

**Key terms:** A **skill** is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` file with
YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`) and markdown instructions for an AI
coding agent. A **[handle](concepts.md#handles)** like `anthropics/skills/pdf`
identifies a skill on GitHub. Install permanently with
[`agr add`](reference.md#agr-add) or run once with [`agrx`](agrx.md).

```bash
agrx anthropics/skills/pdf -p "Extract tables from report.pdf"
```

## Discovering More Skills

### Search GitHub

Any GitHub repository with a [`SKILL.md`](creating.md#skillmd-format) file can be installed as a [handle](concepts.md#handles):

- [Search for SKILL.md files on GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=filename%3ASKILL.md&type=code)

### List skills in a repository

Use the [Python SDK](sdk.md) to list all skills in any repo:

```python
from agr import list_skills

for info in list_skills("anthropics/skills"):
    print(f"{info.handle}: {info.description}")
```

Or check a repo manually — agr looks for any directory containing a `SKILL.md`
file.

### Try before you install

Use [`agrx`](agrx.md) to run any skill without adding it to your project:

```bash
agrx anthropics/skills/webapp-testing
agrx anthropics/skills/pdf -i   # Interactive: continue chatting after the skill runs
```

---

## Share Your Own Skills

### 1. Create a skill

```bash
agr init my-skill
```

Edit the generated `my-skill/SKILL.md` with your instructions. See [`agr init`](reference.md#agr-init) for all options.

### 2. Push to GitHub

Push your skill to a GitHub repository. The recommended structure is a repo named `skills` with one directory per skill:

```text
your-username/skills/
├── my-skill/
│   └── SKILL.md
└── another-skill/
    └── SKILL.md
```

Others can then install with:

```bash
agr add your-username/my-skill
```

### 3. List it here

Open an issue at [github.com/kasperjunge/agent-resources](https://github.com/kasperjunge/agent-resources/issues) to get your skill added to this directory. For [team-wide sharing](teams.md), you can also use a private repository with [`agr.toml`](configuration.md).

See [Creating Skills](creating.md) for a full guide on writing effective skills.
