## Getting Started

Install agr CLI:

```bash
pip install agr
```

Install your first skill:

```bash
agr add anthropics/skills/frontend-design
```

That's it. The skill is now available in your configured tool (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, OpenCode, Copilot, or Antigravity).

---

## What is agr?

**agr** installs agent skills from GitHub directly into your tool's skills folder
(`.claude/skills/`, `.codex/skills/`, `.cursor/skills/`, `.opencode/skill/`, `.github/skills/`, or `.agent/skills/`).

**agrx** runs skills instantly from your terminal — download, run, then clean up.

---

## Install Skills

```bash
agr add anthropics/skills/frontend-design     # Install a skill
agr add -g anthropics/skills/frontend-design  # Install globally for your user
agr add anthropics/skills/pdf anthropics/skills/mcp-builder   # Install multiple
agr add anthropics/skills/pdf --source github # Install from an explicit source
```

Remote installs require `git` to be available on your system.

### Handle format

```
username/skill-name         → From user's skills repo
username/repo/skill-name    → From a specific repo
./path/to/skill             → From local directory
```

Note: `username/skill-name` now defaults to a repo named `skills`. During a
deprecation period, agr will fall back to `agent-resources` (with a warning) if
the skill isn't found in `skills`.

> **Custom repo name?** If your skills live in a repo named anything other than
> `skills` or `agent-resources`, the two-part handle will fail. Use the
> three-part format:
> ```bash
> agr add username/my-custom-repo/skill-name
> ```

---

## Run Skills From Your Terminal

```bash
agrx anthropics/skills/pdf                              # Run a skill instantly
agrx anthropics/skills/pdf -p "Extract tables from report.pdf"   # With a prompt
agrx anthropics/skills/skill-creator -i                 # Run, then continue chatting
agrx anthropics/skills/pdf --tool cursor                # Use a specific tool
```

---

## Team Sync

Your dependencies are tracked in `agr.toml`:

```toml
dependencies = [
    {handle = "anthropics/skills/frontend-design", type = "skill"},
    {handle = "anthropics/skills/brand-guidelines", type = "skill"},
]
```

Teammates run:

```bash
agr sync
```

---

## Create Your Own Skill

```bash
agr init my-skill
```

Creates `my-skill/SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: What this skill does.
---

# My Skill

Instructions for the agent.
```

If you're adding it to this repo, place it under `./skills/`.

Test it locally:

```bash
agr add ./skills/my-skill
```

Share it:

```bash
# Push to GitHub, then others can:
agr add your-username/my-skill
```

---

## Initialize a Repo

```bash
agr init       # Create agr.toml (auto-detects tools)
agr onboard    # Interactive guided setup
```

`agr init` creates `agr.toml` and detects which tools you use from repo signals (`.claude/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursor/`, etc.).

`agr onboard` walks you through tool selection, skill discovery, migration, and configuration interactively.

---

## Coming from npx skills?

agr uses a slightly different handle format than `npx skills`:

| What you want | npx skills | agr |
|---|---|---|
| Skill from a repo | `npx skills add owner/repo` | `agr add owner/repo/skill-name` |
| Skill from user's default repo | — | `agr add owner/skill-name` |

The key difference: `agr` handles always point to a **specific skill**, not a
repo to scan. Use the three-part format `owner/repo/skill-name` when the skill
lives in a non-default repo.

If you use a two-part handle and the skill isn't found, `agr` will check if a
matching repository exists and suggest the correct handles.
