## What are skills?

Skills are reusable instructions that teach AI coding agents how to perform
specific tasks. Each skill is a `SKILL.md` file in a directory, published on
GitHub:

```markdown
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Reviews code for bugs, security issues, and best practices.
---

# Code Reviewer

When reviewing code changes, follow these steps:

1. Read every changed file completely before commenting
2. Check for bugs: null references, off-by-one errors, race conditions
3. Check for security issues: injection, auth bypass, data exposure
4. Verify error handling: are errors caught, logged, and surfaced?

Format each finding as:
- **File and line:** `src/auth.py:42`
- **Severity:** bug / security / style
- **Fix:** concrete code or approach to resolve it
```

Install it, and your AI agent gains a new capability — no prompt engineering
each time. Without a package manager, you'd copy these files manually into each
tool's config folder, keep them updated by hand, and hope your teammates have
the same versions. **agr automates all of that.**

---

## Getting Started

Install the CLI:

```bash
uv tool install agr       # recommended
# or: pipx install agr
# or: pip install agr
```

Install your first skill:

```bash
agr add anthropics/skills/frontend-design
```

Then invoke it in your AI tool:

| Tool | Invoke with |
|------|-------------|
| Claude Code | `/frontend-design` |
| Cursor | `/frontend-design` |
| OpenAI Codex | `$frontend-design` |
| OpenCode | `frontend-design` |
| GitHub Copilot | `/frontend-design` |

No setup required — `agr add` auto-creates `agr.toml` and detects which tools
you use.

---

## Run a skill without installing

**agrx** downloads a skill, runs it with your tool's CLI, and cleans up. Nothing
is saved to your project:

```bash
agrx anthropics/skills/pdf -p "Extract tables from report.pdf"
agrx anthropics/skills/skill-creator -i   # Interactive: skill + chat
```

---

## Team sync

Dependencies are tracked in `agr.toml` — commit it, and teammates install
everything with one command:

```toml
dependencies = [
    {handle = "anthropics/skills/frontend-design", type = "skill"},
    {handle = "anthropics/skills/pdf", type = "skill"},
]
```

```bash
agr sync   # Like npm install, but for agent skills
```

---

## Create and share

```bash
agr init my-skill                # Scaffold a new skill
# Edit my-skill/SKILL.md with your instructions
agr add ./my-skill               # Test locally
# Push to GitHub, then others can:
agr add your-username/my-skill
```

---

## Example skills

**Documents & data:**

```bash
agr add anthropics/skills/pdf       # Read, extract, create PDFs
agr add anthropics/skills/docx      # Generate and edit Word documents
agr add anthropics/skills/xlsx      # Build and manipulate spreadsheets
```

**Design & frontend:**

```bash
agr add anthropics/skills/frontend-design   # Production-grade interfaces
agr add anthropics/skills/canvas-design     # Visual art in PNG and PDF
```

**Development:**

```bash
agr add anthropics/skills/claude-api        # Build apps with the Claude API
agr add anthropics/skills/mcp-builder       # Create MCP servers
agr add anthropics/skills/webapp-testing    # Test web apps with Playwright
```
